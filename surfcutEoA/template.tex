% call for the natbib-system if you wish to have sophisticated citations,
% remember to adapt the references at the end of your contribution then
% see explanation at the end of this file.
%
% A detailed explanation and demonstration of the natbib system can
% be found at
%     http://merkel.zoneo.net/Latex/natbib.php
%
% If you use BibTeX to manage your citation use the style "spbasic.bst"
% that is "natbib" aware.

\usepackage{graphicx}    % standard LaTeX graphics tool
                         % when including figure files

% \usepackage{amsfonts,amsmath} % useful for typesetting complicated math

% Hint:
% Use the "hyperref" package in the preamble
% if you want to supply active links within
% your text; e.g. at the \CrossRef section
% \usepackage{hyperref}

% Hint:
% Use the package "url" in the preamble
% to avoid problems with special characters
% used in your e-mail or web address in the
% \author or the \institute field below
% \usepackage{url}
% \urlstyle{tt}    % URLs are typeset in typewriter font

\begin{document}

% Please specify your Entry Title in one continuous line
\title{}

% Please specify the Names of Entry Author(s)
\author{}
% if there is more than one author, use "\and" in between
% the particular author lines
%
% add "\inst{<No.>}" directly after the author name to indicate
% the mapping to the relevant affiliations/addresses in the
% forthcoming "\institute" field
%
% see also the example contribution file "example.tex" for detailed info

% Please specify your Address/Affiliation and use "\\" as EOL for structuring
% specify Phone / Fax / e-mail if applicable, use "\\" as EOL for structuring
% more than one address/affiliation? separate each two entries with
% a line containing "\and"
\institute{}
% make sure to give at least as many institute addresses
% as the mapping to the authors requires;
% the numbering is done automatically by the "\and" command
% see also the example contribution file "example.tex" for detailed info

% Please specify Years and Authors of Summarized Original Work
% use one continuous line for each paper; use semicolon to separate
% the year from the last names; don't use "and" between author names
% adhere to the following format:
% "Year of paper"; "last names of authors" separated by commas without "and"
% use "\\" as EOL for structuring
\sumoriwork{}
% see also the example contribution file "example.tex"
% for detailed information
%

% Please specify the Keywords - use semicolon for separation
\keywords{}

\maketitle  % completes, checks, and typesets the contribution's head

% you have 7 predefined headings at hand you can use throughout your contribution;
% just call the relevant commands instead of generating a new "\section" for them;
% the next two headings are mandatory:
% \ProbDef   -   Problem Definition
% \KeyRes    -   Key Results
%
% the following heading commands may be used as and when required:
% \Applic    -   Applications
% \OpenProb  -   Open Problems
% \ExpRes    -   Experimental Results
% \DataSets  -   URLs to Code and Data Sets
% \CrossRef  -   Cross References
