\section{Conclusions and Open Problems}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Many potential improvements and open questions remain.  For example, unlike the flow algorithms described in Chambers, Erickson, and Nayyeri~\cite{cen-hfcc-12}, our minimum $(s,t)$-cut algorithms do not seem to extend easily to embedded \emph{directed} graphs.  Computing minimum $(s,t)$-cuts in directed graphs embedded on a surface in near-linear time remains an open question.

We conjecture \note{believe?} that maximum $(s,t)$-flows, minimum $(s,t)$-cuts, and global minimum cuts in embedded graphs can be computed in $O(g^k n\log n)$ time for some small constant $k$, perhaps using a
generalization of the network simplex algorithm of Borradaile and
Klein \cite{b-epnfc-08, bk-amfdp-09}.  Even the special
case of unit capacities is open.
