Minimum cuts in surface graphs (tentative title). By Erin W. Chambers, Jeff Erickson, Kyle Fox, and Amir Nayyeri.



Abstract: Let G be an edge-weighted directed graph with n vertices embedded on an orientable surface of genus g. We describe algorithms to efficiently compute minimum s,t-cuts and global minimum cuts of G.
